# NBA-Chatron_3760
Design and implementation for an NBA chatbot app that can answer inquiries about NBA player statistics via website or Slackbot App (Software Engineering course project)

This was a group project created in phases (milestones) throughout a semester and designed by following requirements and rubrics that were put in place for both the project itself as well as for the design of the course and grading groups. This was completed in groups that were required to work with a TA and professor, as well as an external product owner that was very involved throughout the duration of the project.
